	Hello and thank you for looking into my graphic Hello World program called GUIHello. 
This is my very first python project completed by myself with no outside help or resources.
I have only been learning python for about 4 days at the point of posting this project.
the morale of the story is, if i can do it you can too, take this code and study it, 
when you feel that you know whats going on and what controlls what, i encourage you 
to tinker with it, make it unique. Have fun with it.

To be clear this is a worthless program that simply runs an updating command loop.
